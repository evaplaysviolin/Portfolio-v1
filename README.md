# Portfolio Website

[Portfolio](http://evaplaysviolin.github.io)

Having recently completed a front-end self-study course, I was in need of a place to showcase some of my coding work. I decided to create a website I could point people to if they wanted to more easily see examples of my projects or read more about me in general. As I continue my foray into web development I expect to add more projects or make improvements to the existing site. I welcome all comments anyone may have for me!

### SPA for GitHub

I built my site as a single page application, which GitHub Pages doesn't support. The workaround is to essentially hijack the 404 page that the user will hit when they refresh, and I used code for that from here: https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages
