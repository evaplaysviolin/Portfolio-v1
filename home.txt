      <p><b>Current year:</b> Continued self-study for front-end web development. 
        Recently acquired a certificate from freeCodeCamp. 
        As always, working on “commissions” from friends and family.</p>

      <p><b>Last year:</b> Event planning for (own) wedding. 
        Coordination of all aspects, including creation of wedding website, which was the first project undertaken shortly after deciding to study web development. 
        “What’s a server side language?”</p>

      <p><b>Two years ago:</b> Second half of two-woman team responsible for planning 10,000-participant medical congress in Guadalajara. 
        Two years of Spanish in high school came in somewhat useful. 
        Upon return, immediately commenced preparation for next meeting in Barcelona.</p>

      <p><b>Four years ago:</b> Began event management position. 
        100% work-from-home (new and exciting). 
        Learned to spell and pronounce “ophthalmology” in a hurry.</p>

      <p><b>Five years ago:</b> Purchasing Department, AKA “The people who stock your coffee and cannot believe how quickly it is consumed.” 
        Stocking 20+ essentially independent offices (not just for coffee) was an exercise in maintaining both productivity and sanity.</p>

      <p><b>Six years ago:</b> Despite not knowing anything about wine, was hired to handle administrative work for wine certification exams. 
        Annual conference was an experience in watching sommeliers get absolutely sloshed together through consecutive wine tasting sessions.</p>

      <p><b>Twenty something years ago:</b> Born, with no prior work experience.</p>
